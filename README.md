How to Play Star Jammers
In Star Jammers, you control a spaceship in intense arena battles. Use the arrow keys to move your ship with precision and dodge enemy attacks.
To activate your special abilities, press M, Space, or Enter, depending on your chosen ship. These abilities include Dash for quick escapes, energy shots to attack opponents, or special attacks that vary based on your playstyle.

The game features four dynamic arenas, each with unique rules to challenge your skills:

### Conquest Board – Capture and hold strategic zones to score points.
### Capture the Flag – Steal the enemy’s flag and return it to your base.
### Death Capture – Defeat opponents to earn points.
### Claim the Banner – Hold the banner for as long as possible to win.

To win a round in Star Jammers, you must collect the most stars within the time limit. Stars can be obtained in different ways depending on the arena you’re playing in.
A status banner displays who’s in the lead in real time, identifying players by their ship’s color. This helps you track your rivals' performance and adjust your strategy accordingly.
Each arena has a 60-second time limit, making matches fast-paced and intense. When time runs out, the player or team with the most stars wins the round.
Make every second count—collect stars, outplay your opponents, and secure victory.

# Whalepass and Avalanche Blockchain

My game is a fast-paced arcade experience where quick thinking and reflexes are the key to survival if you hesitate, you lose. I wanted to create something that captures that classic, high-intensity gameplay where every second matters.
From the start, I had planned to integrate several interactions with the Avalanche blockchain, but as the final hours of development approached, things got more complicated than expected. Because of that, I had to scale back some of my original ideas.
Integration and connection with Whalepass back-end API to obtain Player_ID and lastLevelCompleted, without the need for complex lists or saving on another platform.​

The Battlepass system is designed to be similar to modern MOBA or FPS games, in that you get an amount (X) of XP, and are then eligible to redeem Battlepass rewards. Again, entirely on-chain using Whalepass.​
